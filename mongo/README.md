I have followed the MVR architecture in my backend application <br/>
In the controller, I have added all the functions for CRUD operation. In models, I have defined a user-based schema that serves the purpose of interface design of data which I am going to store in the Database. <br/>
For setting up routing, I have configured routing in the routes folder ans used mux for this purpose.
